# Welcome to Docq

[Docq](https://github.com/docqai) is a group of open source projects developed and sponsored by FABR Ltd t/a [Docq.AI](https://docq.ai).

Community engagement is important to us.

- On GitHub, each OSS project is set up to facilitate issue tracking and discussions, beside the code.
- Off GitHub, each OSS project has Slack and Trello to engage with broader communities of people.
