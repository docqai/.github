# Default GitHub Organisation Repo

For **Docq**, we use GitHub's `.github` repo to organise the open source development and engage with the community. That includes:

- Community health files (mostly in the root of the repo)
- Templates (mostly in `/.github` directory)
- Organisation profile page (in `/profile` directory)

As any changes in this repo likely affect all Docq-sponsored OSS work on GitHub, please use <support@docq.ai> to make suggestions on changes you like to see here.
